# WeatherNow
Team project for DigitalCrafts
WeatherNow is a Weather app we designed using JavaScript, Html and Css. This project helped us to understand the core basics of the DOM which taught our group how to use fetch API, to call and get data from a third-party service.
 
To style our app we used CSS flexbox. 

We will use a website called OpenWeatherMap. OpenWeatherMap is a service that provides various weather data through API. We can integrate the API into our app and can use the data on our website
